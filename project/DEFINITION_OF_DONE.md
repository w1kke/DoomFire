# Definition of Done (for this prototype)

A feature/PR is done when:
- Acceptance criteria impacted by the PR are updated and still pass.
- At least one new/updated automated test covers the change.
- Security policy for Preview/Engage mode is not weakened.
- Docs are updated (or a conscious "no doc change" statement is included).
